## Incident Report / Postmortem
## Overview
On April 2nd, 2023 at 10:23 AM, an incident occurred in the SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) department, which resulted in a temporary outage of the company's web application. This report aims to provide a detailed account of what happened, what steps were taken to mitigate the issue, and what measures have been put in place to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

## Timeline of Events
10:23 AM: Initial discovery of the fault by the company's monitoring system, which alerted the SRE team of high latency and increased error rates.
10:24 AM: SRE team notified of the issue and began investigating.
10:27 AM: The SRE team identified that the root cause of the fault was due to a recent change in the load balancing configuration, which caused traffic to be distributed unevenly across the application's servers.
10:28 AM: The SRE team rolled back the load balancing configuration to the previous version to mitigate the issue.
10:30 AM: The company's web application was fully operational again, and traffic was evenly distributed across all servers.
10:35 AM: The SRE team conducted a postmortem analysis to identify the underlying cause of the issue and to prevent it from happening again in the future.

## Root Cause Analysis
The root cause of the issue was traced back to a recent change made to the load balancing configuration, which was intended to optimize the application's performance. However, due to a misconfiguration, the load balancer started routing traffic to only a few servers, resulting in high latency and increased error rates.

## Mitigation Steps
The SRE team quickly identified the issue and rolled back the load balancing configuration to the previous version, which ensured that traffic was evenly distributed across all servers. This quick action helped to minimize the impact of the outage, and the application was fully operational again within a few minutes.

## Preventive Measures
To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, the SRE team has implemented several measures. First, they have added more rigorous testing procedures for all configuration changes to ensure that any potential issues are identified before being deployed to production. Second, the team has increased monitoring and alerting capabilities to quickly identify and mitigate any issues that arise. Finally, the SRE team has implemented a more robust incident response plan to ensure that all team members are prepared to handle incidents quickly and effectively.
